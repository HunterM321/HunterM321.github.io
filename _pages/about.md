I am a 5th year student in Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia, specializing in robotics and machine learning. My research interests lie in state estimation, robot perception, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) in embodied AI.

I conducted field robotics research at the [University of Toronto Robotics Institute](https://robotics.utoronto.ca) under Prof. [Tim Barfoot](http://asrl.utias.utoronto.ca/~tdb/) on Virtual Teach & Repeat. I also worked with Prof Chul Min Yeum at the University of Waterloo's [Computer Vision for Smart Structure (CViSS) Lab](https://cviss.net) on Gaussian Splatting. Currently, I'm working with Prof. [Renjie Liao](https://lrjconan.github.io) on Vision-Language quadruped robot. Beyond research, I led the Control System subteam for [UBC Orbit Satellite Design Team](https://www.ubcorbit.com), contributing to orbit simulation and embedded systems.

I was awarded the Faculty of Applied Science International Student Scholarship (2025), Captain C Y Wu Scholarship (2025), and Waterloo Engineering Rising Stars Fellowship (2024) for my academic and research excellence.
