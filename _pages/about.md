I am a fourth-year Bachelor of Applied Science student majoring in Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Currently, I lead the Controls subteam for [UBC Orbit Satellite Design Team](https://www.ubcorbit.com) and serve on the Software subteam for the [UBC Rover Design Team](https://ubcrover.com).

My research interests lie in the intersection of **machine learning**, **computer vision**, **control systems**, and its applications to robotics and autonomous systems. In particular, I seek to **integrate modern neural network methodologies into classical control problems**, aiming to advance the state of the art in both domains. Additionally, I am very interested in **Physics-Informed Neural Networks**.

During the Summer of 2024, I was awarded a scholarship through the [Waterloo Engineering Rising Stars Fellowship Program](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/waterloo-engineering-rising-stars-fellowship-program) and joined the [Computer Vision for Smart Structure (CViSS) Lab](https://cviss.net) at the University of Waterloo under the supervision of [Prof. Chul Min Yeum](https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/profile/cmyeum). There, I investigated **Gaussian Splatting neural volume rendering**, working on methods to enhance training speed, improve reconstruction accuracy for high-fidelity structures, and improve camera pose estimation by incorporating LiDAR SLAM. In Fall 2024, I joined the [Robotics and Control Lab (RCL)](https://rcl.ece.ubc.ca) in UBCâ€™s Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, supervised by [Prof. Purang Abolmaesumi](https://ece.ubc.ca/purang-abolmaesumi/). My work focused on **fine-tuning [Florence 2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large) and [SAM 2](https://ai.meta.com/sam2/) for echocardiogram chamber segmentation**, as well as extending these image segmentation methods to video object segmentation and tracking. I have also held internships at [Microchip Technology](https://www.microchip.com) as a hardware engineer and at [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca) (Canada's Particle Accelerator Center, formerly known as Canada's National Laboratory for Particle and Nuclear Physics) as an electronics research assistant.

My coursework emphasizes mathematics and spans machine learning, computer vision, control systems, optimization, and physics, among other areas. I have been involved in a range of technical projects, including those from my design team experiences and individual robotics work, which you can learn more about in the [projects](projects) page.
