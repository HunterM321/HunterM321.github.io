I am a fourth-year Bachelor of Applied Science student majoring in Engineering Physics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Currently, I lead the Controls subteam for [UBC Orbit Satellite Design Team](https://www.ubcorbit.com) and serve on the Software subteam for the [UBC Rover Design Team](https://ubcrover.com).

My research interests lie in the intersection of **machine learning**, **computer vision**, **control systems**, and its applications to robotics and autonomous systems. In particular, I seek to **integrate modern neural network methodologies into classical control problems**, aiming to advance the state of the art in both domains. Additionally, I am very interested in **Physics-Informed Neural Networks**.

During Summer 2024, I was awarded a scholarship through the [Waterloo Engineering Rising Stars Fellowship Program](https://uwaterloo.ca/engineering/waterloo-engineering-rising-stars-fellowship-program) and joined the [Computer Vision for Smart Structure (CViSS) Lab](https://cviss.net) at the University of Waterloo under [Prof. Chul Min Yeum](https://uwaterloo.ca/civil-environmental-engineering/profile/cmyeum). I worked on **Gaussian Splatting neural volume rendering**, enhancing training speed, reconstruction accuracy for high-fidelity structures, and camera pose estimation using LiDAR SLAM. 

In Fall 2024, I joined UBC's [Robotics and Control Lab (RCL)](https://rcl.ece.ubc.ca) under [Prof. Purang Abolmaesumi](https://ece.ubc.ca/purang-abolmaesumi/), focusing on **fine-tuning [Florence 2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Florence-2-large) and [SAM 2](https://ai.meta.com/sam2/)** for echocardiogram chamber segmentation and extending these methods to video object segmentation and tracking.

My coursework emphasizes mathematics and spans machine learning, computer vision, control systems, optimization, and physics, among other areas. I have been involved in a range of technical projects, including those from my design team experiences and individual robotics work, which you can learn more about in the [projects](projects) page.
