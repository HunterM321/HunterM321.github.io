description: Currently I have 3 co-authored papers in progress. Two from Summer 2024 with CViSS at UWaterloo and one from Fall 2024 with RCL at UBC. My teammates and I are also thinking of turning our Deep Learning-based Dynamical System Solver report into a paper if time permits. I will update this page if more news comes through!
