Additionally, we used <a href="https://ahrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Attitude and Heading Reference Systems</a> (AHRS) Python library as a secondary source of reference.</em></p> <h4 id="spacecraft-dynamics">Spacecraft dynamics</h4> <p>To come up with a solution to a control problem, we always need to first start with the <strong>dynamics</strong> of the model. This is nothing but a glorified way of describing \(\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}\), Newton‚Äôs second law of motion which we learned in high school or first-year university physics. This model characterizes how the state of our system changes with time given our system inputs and existing measurements. Our CubeSat has very complex dynamics as we utilize and fuse multiple sensors to obtain the observed state, yet each sensor has its distinct noise distribution.</p> <p>To fully characterize the state of our CubeSat, we <em>simply</em> need to know the orientation, or in a more professional way, the <strong>attitude</strong>, of the CubeSat. We chose to use the industry-standard <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternions_and_spatial_rotation" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">quaternions</a></strong> to represent the attitude of the CubeSat. Quaternions can be thought as an extension of complex numbers and have the form:</p> \[\mathbf{q} = w + x\mathbf{i} + y\mathbf{j} + z\mathbf{k}\] <p>Notice that in this definition, the real scalar part comes before the complex vector part; some literatures prefer the other way around. Recall in complex analysis, a multiplication of \(i\) corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation of 90 degrees in the complex plane. Quaternions generalize this idea into 3D space while delivering several advantages, including:</p> <ul> <li>Quaternions don‚Äôt suffer limitations such as <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gimbal_lock" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">gimbal lock</a></strong> which arises from using Euler angles (row, pitch, yaw) to represent 3D rotations.</li> <li>When representing 3D rotation using Euler angles, we need to establish a \(3 \times 3\) rotation matrix which consists of 9 entries. A quaternion with the same rotation effect only uses 4 entries, saving half of the space which accumulates in large computations.</li> </ul> <p>We are using unit quaternions (i.e., \(\|\mathbf{q}\| = 1\)) to represent attitude, hence we can reduce the quaternion representation further to only use the complex vector part, called the <strong>reduced quaternion</strong>. From now on, I will be using \(\mathbf{q}\) to exclusively indicate reduced quaternion. <em>Moreover, in this section we will only use the <strong>gyroscope</strong> inside our IMU as our attitude determination instrument</em>. Now equipped with the knowledge of quaternions, we can proceed to write down the dynamics of our CubeSat:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}} &amp;= -\mathbf{J}^{-1} \boldsymbol{\omega} \times (\mathbf{J} \boldsymbol{\omega}) + \mathbf{J}^{-1} \mathbf{u} + \boldsymbol{\phi}_1 \\ \dot{\mathbf{q}} &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \mathbf{\Omega}(\boldsymbol{\omega} + \boldsymbol{\phi}_2) \\ \dot{\boldsymbol{\beta}} &amp;= \boldsymbol{\phi}_3 \\ \boldsymbol{\omega}_y &amp;= \boldsymbol{\omega} + \boldsymbol{\beta} + \boldsymbol{\psi}_1 \\ \mathbf{q}_y &amp;= \mathbf{q} + \boldsymbol{\psi}_2 \end{aligned}\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(\mathbf{J}\): Inertial matrix of the CubeSat</li> <li>\(\boldsymbol{\omega}\): CubeSat angular rate with respect to the inertial frame</li> <li>\(\mathbf{u}\): Control input</li> <li>\(\mathbf{\Omega}\): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skew-symmetric_matrix#:~:text=In%20mathematics%2C%20particularly%20in%20linear,whose%20transpose%20equals%20its%20negative." rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Skew-symmetric</a> matrix defined as</li> </ul> \[\mathbf{\Omega} = \begin{bmatrix} g(\mathbf{q}) &amp; -q_3 &amp; q_2 \\ q_3 &amp; g(\mathbf{q}) &amp; -q_1 \\ -q_2 &amp; q_1 &amp; g(\mathbf{q}) \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{with} \quad g(\mathbf{q}) = \sqrt{1 - q_1^2 - q_2^2 - q_3^2}.\] <ul> <li>\(\boldsymbol{\phi}_1\), \(\boldsymbol{\phi}_2\), \(\boldsymbol{\phi}_3\): Process zero-mean Gaussian noise</li> <li>\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\): Drift in gyro angular measurement</li> <li>\(\boldsymbol{\omega}_y\): Gyro angular rate measurement</li> <li>\(\mathbf{q}_y\): Reduced quaternion measurement</li> <li>\(\boldsymbol{\psi}_1\), \(\boldsymbol{\psi}_2\): Measurement zero-mean Gaussian noise</li> </ul> <p>We can thus easily convert this into a state space model for a more streamlined analysis later:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \dot{\mathbf{x}} &amp;= \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \boldsymbol{\phi}) \\ \mathbf{y} &amp;= \mathbf{H} \mathbf{x} + \boldsymbol{\psi} \end{aligned}\] <p>Where</p> \[\mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\omega} \\ \mathbf{q} \\ \boldsymbol{\beta} \end{bmatrix}, \: \mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\omega}_y \\ \mathbf{q}_y \end{bmatrix}, \: \boldsymbol{\phi} = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\phi}_1 \\ \boldsymbol{\phi}_2 \\ \boldsymbol{\phi}_3 \end{bmatrix}, \: \boldsymbol{\psi} = \begin{bmatrix} \boldsymbol{\psi}_1 \\ \boldsymbol{\psi}_2 \end{bmatrix}, \: \mathbf{H} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{I}_3 &amp; \mathbf{0}_3 &amp; \mathbf{I}_3 \\ \mathbf{0}_3 &amp; \mathbf{I}_3 &amp; \mathbf{0}_3 \end{bmatrix}.\] <p>Here \(\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^9\) is the <strong>state</strong> of the system and \(\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^6\) is the measurement. The measurement‚Äôs primary goal is to correct our state, which I will explain later. One caveat of this state space model is that it is still in the form of <strong>continuous-time ordinary differential equations</strong>, but our computer would much appreciate if we can convert this into <strong>discrete-time algebric equations</strong>. This shouldn‚Äôt be too hard since we already knew the sampling period \(\Delta t\) and parameterized the state derivative with \(\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u}, \boldsymbol{\phi})\), a <strong>first-order approximation</strong>, synonymous to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Euler‚Äôs method</a></strong>, would suffice:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathbf{x}_{k+1} &amp; = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k) + \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}_k, \boldsymbol{\phi}_k) \\ \mathbf{y}_k &amp; = \mathbf{H} \mathbf{x}_k + \boldsymbol{\psi}_k \end{aligned}\] <p>Here I won‚Äôt go in-depth into the derivation as section 8.4 of the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240009554" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">book</a> shows the interesting math behind. In short, the <strong>nonlinear</strong> state transition function \(\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_k, \mathbf{u}_k)\) advances the present state \(\mathbf{x}_{k}\) through \(\Delta t\), and the <strong>nonlinear</strong> noise transition function \(\mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}_k, \boldsymbol{\phi}_k)\) makes sure the process noises are also propagated to together produce the next state \(\mathbf{x}_{k+1}\). \(\mathbf{H}\) is called the <strong>observation model matrix</strong> which simply links the present state and measurement.</p> <h4 id="wahbas-problem">Wahba‚Äôs problem</h4> <p>It may seem like we have everything in place to talk about the control system, but we are still missing one critical piece. Let‚Äôs examine the initialization state \(\mathbf{x}_0 \in \mathbb{R}^9\): we can easily obtain \(\boldsymbol{\omega}_0\) from our gyro reading and \(\boldsymbol{\beta}_0\) by setting it to \(\mathbf{0}_3\), but how do we initialize the reduced quaternion \(\mathbf{q}_0\)? Remember so far we only used our gyro and have left the <strong>accelerometer</strong> and <strong>magnetometer</strong> untouched, so we better make use of them and not leave them to collect dust.</p> <p>This issue has been generalized to a well-known mathematical problem called the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahba%27s_problem" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wahba‚Äôs problem</a></strong>. Specifically, this problem attempts to find a rotation matrix (or in our case, a reduced quaternion) between two coordinate systems from a set of weighted observation vectors. It does so by finding an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">orthogonal matrix</a> \(\mathbf{R}\) that minimizes the loss function:</p> \[L(\mathbf{R}) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=1}^n a_i \left\| \mathbf{\hat{w}}_i - \mathbf{R} \mathbf{\hat{v}}_i \right\|^2\] <p>where \(a_i\) are a set of non-negative weights such that \(\sum_{i=1}^n a_i = 1\), \(\mathbf{\hat{v}}_i\) are nonparallel <strong>reference vectors</strong>, and \(\mathbf{\hat{w}}_i\) are the corresponding <strong>observation vectors</strong>, which we obtain through the accelerometer and magnetometer.</p> <p>There exists many algorithms that approximate the solution, one of which is called <strong><a href="https://ahrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filters/quest.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Quaternion Estimator</a></strong> (QUEST), which is our algorithm of choice. It is widely used in the aerospace and robotics industry thanks to its highly efficient computation. QUEST‚Äôs solution is daunting yet elegant, it uses methods like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley%E2%80%93Hamilton_theorem" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cayley-Hamilton theorem</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Newton-Raphson‚Äôs root finding</a> to simplify and solve the characteristic equation. I highly recommend checking out the link above to learn more. QUEST in the end will tell us an optimal solution to the reduced quaternion \(\mathbf{q}_0\), which we can plug into our state vector \(\mathbf{x}_0\) to complete the initialization. Furthermore, this optimal quaternion is also our measurement quaternion \(\mathbf{q}_{y_k} \: \forall k \in \mathbb{N}\). Together with the gyro measurement \(\mathbf{w}_{y_k}\), this forms our measurement vector \(\mathbf{y}_k\).</p> <h4 id="extended-kalman-filter">Extended Kalman Filter</h4> <p>It wouldn‚Äôt be a satellite‚Äôs control system without the presence of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kalman Filter</a></strong> (KF). I have hyped things up so far just so I can introduce the bread and butter of AOCS. Originally intorduced in the 1960s, Kalman Filter‚Äôs debut was to help the Americans be the first and only nation to set their feet on the lunar soil. More than 60 years later, KF has undergone countless iterations, yet it still stands as one of the most important inventions in control theory. The <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Extended Kalman Filter</a></strong> (EKF) is argubly one of the most important flavors of KF, which acknowledges the universe is in fact <strong>nonlinear</strong> and thus adds a linearization layer on top of KF. It was also technically the algorithm that was on-board Apollo‚Äôs guidance and navigation computer.</p> <p><em>Note that even though KF bears the name ‚Äúfilter‚Äù, it is still <strong>NOT</strong> to be confused with the traditional filter in signal processing (e.g., low-pass filter), despite it has the ability to smooth out noisy signal. They really don‚Äôt have too much in common.</em></p> <p>There are some important primises that help establish EKF. First and foremost, EKF is inherently a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Markov process</a></strong>, meaning <em>the past is independent of the future given the present</em>. In mathematical formulation, we can write it as:</p> \[P(X_{n+1} = \mathbf{x}_{n+1} \mid X_n = \mathbf{x}_n, \dots, X_1 = \mathbf{x}_1) = P(X_{n+1} = \mathbf{x}_{n+1} \mid X_n = \mathbf{x}_n), \: \forall n \in \mathbb{N}\] <p>The second key premise of EKF is that since it‚Äôs a <strong>probabilistic</strong> approach, it assumes that all noises involved in the process are <strong>zero-mean Gaussian distributions</strong>. Whether this is an accurate assumption is up for debate, but modeling noises using Gaussian distributions definitely has its own benefits and this concept is widely adpated in many other fields.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/kf-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/kf-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/kf-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/kf.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" title="Kalman Filter" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The essence of Kalman Filter: predict, correct, and repeat </div> <p>In a nutshell, EKF operates in a <strong>recursive</strong> manner where in each iteration, it gives a <strong>prediction</strong> by passing the previous EKF ouput through the system dynamics model, then it attempts to perform <strong>correction</strong> using the current measurement, all before passing the new output back to the input for the next loop. Specifically, we would compute:</p> <p><strong>Prediction</strong></p> \[\begin{aligned} \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k} &amp; = \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{x}_{k-1}, \mathbf{u}_{k-1}) + \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{x}_{k-1}, \boldsymbol{\phi}_{k-1}) \\ \hat{\mathbf{P}}_{k} &amp; = \mathbf{F}_{k-1} \mathbf{P}_{k-1} \mathbf{F}_{k-1}^\top + \mathbf{L}_{k-1} \mathbf{Q}_{k-1} \mathbf{L}_{k-1}^\top \end{aligned}\] <p><strong>Correction</strong></p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathbf{v}_k &amp; = \mathbf{y}_k - \mathbf{H} \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k} \\ \mathbf{S}_k &amp; = \mathbf{H} \hat{\mathbf{P}}_{k} \mathbf{H}^\top + \mathbf{R}_k \\ \mathbf{K}_k &amp; = \hat{\mathbf{P}}_{k} \mathbf{H}^\top \mathbf{S}_k^{-1} \\ \mathbf{x}_{k} &amp; = \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k} + \mathbf{K}_k \mathbf{v}_k \\ \mathbf{P}_{k} &amp; = (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{K}_k \mathbf{H}) \hat{\mathbf{P}}_{k} \end{aligned}\] <p>The derivation of these equations are rather daunting and time-consuming (yet extremely interesting), so I won‚Äôt go too in-depth here and instead will leave it to your discretion to decide. Aagin, section 8.4 of the <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20240009554" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">book</a> goes over the calculation details. I also find <a href="https://ahrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filters/ekf.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AHRS‚Äôs implementation</a> to be pretty interesting and relatively easy to digest, though they chose to use a different state vector \(\mathbf{x}\) which changes their state space model, it is still a good read.

They are the <strong>process covariance matrix</strong> \(\mathbf{Q}\) and the <strong>measurement covariance matrix</strong> \(\mathbf{R}\). <em>The process covariance matrix captures the uncertainty arising from system dynamics, while the measurement covariance matrix captures the uncertainty arising from the measuring instruments</em>. They are <strong>diagonal matrices</strong> since we made the assumption that the <strong>random variables</strong> in each matrix are independent of each other, resulting in a covariance of 0 in the non-diagonals. For example, it is fair to assume that the gyroscope measurement in each axis is <strong>independent</strong> and bears no impact on the other axes. We additionally made the assumption that the process noises are also independent of the measurement noises. In reality, these assumptions may very well not be the case, but it is the best we could do. The matrices are derived from the process and measurement noises introduced in the spacecraft dynamics section. We can formulate \(\mathbf{Q}\) and \(\mathbf{R}\) in the following way:</p> \[\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{\phi}_k] = 0, \: \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{\psi}_k] = 0, \: \forall k\] \[\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{\phi}_k \boldsymbol{\phi}_k^\top] = \mathbf{Q}_k, \: \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{\psi}_k \boldsymbol{\psi}_k^\top] = \mathbf{R}_k, \: \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{\psi}_i \boldsymbol{\phi}_j^\top] = 0, \: \forall i, j, k\] \[\mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{\phi}_i \boldsymbol{\phi}_j^\top] = 0, \: \mathbb{E}[\boldsymbol{\psi}_i \boldsymbol{\psi}_j^\top] = 0, \: \forall i \neq j\] <p>Note that \(\mathbf{Q}\) and \(\mathbf{R}\) are not to be confused with the <strong>state covariance matrix</strong> \(\mathbf{P}\). One noticeable difference is that there is no restriction on whether \(\mathbf{P}\) should be a diagonal matrix. In fact, it is highly unlikely that \(\mathbf{P}\) is a diagonal matrix since it is constantly getting updated in each iteration. The state covariance matrix undergoes the same prediction and correction procedure as its buddy, the state vector \(\mathbf{x}\). The predicted \(\hat{\mathbf{P}}_{k}\) is directly influenced by \(\mathbf{Q}_{k-1}\), and the value is corrected indirectly by \(\mathbf{R}_{k}\) to yield the final state covariance \(\mathbf{P}_{k}\).</p> <p>So far our discussion only involves things that are common between KF and EKF, and we have not gone into what makes EKF special‚Äîhandling nonlinear system with proper linearization. In fact, our system dynamics model is indeed a nonlinear system, as reflected by \(\mathbf{F}\) and \(\mathbf{G}\). To obtain the predicted state covariance matrix \(\hat{\mathbf{P}}_k\), we need to first linearize both \(\mathbf{F}\) and \(\mathbf{G}\). This is done through <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Taylor expansion</a></strong> about the point \((\mathbf{x}_{k-1}, \mathbf{u}_{k-1})\), equivalent to finding the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jacobians</a></strong> of \(\mathbf{F}\) and \(\mathbf{G}\). This first-order approximation is computationally efficient and precise enough for our application, especially considering we don‚Äôt have the luxury to run heavy tasks on our MCU. The linearized \(\mathbf{F}_{k-1}\) and \(\mathbf{L}_{k-1}\) can be computed by:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathbf{F}_{k-1} &amp;= \left. \frac{\partial \mathbf{F}}{\partial \mathbf{x}} \right|_{\mathbf{x}_{k-1}, \mathbf{u}_{k-1}} \\ \mathbf{L}_{k-1} &amp;= \left. \frac{\partial \mathbf{G}}{\partial \boldsymbol{\phi}_k} \right|_{\mathbf{x}_{k-1}, \mathbf{u}_{k-1}} \end{aligned}\] <p>Lastly, I will introduce the two quantities that help us correct our prediction and output the final Gaussian distribution composed of \(\mathbf{x}_k\) and \(\mathbf{P}_k\), which are the <strong>innovation</strong> \(\mathbf{v}_k\) and the <strong>Kalman gain</strong> \(\mathbf{K}_k\). The innovation is sometimes referred to as the <strong>measurement residual</strong>. In short, it measures the gap between the predicted state and measurement. The bigger the gap, the more <em>off</em> our measurement is compared to our system dynamics model, and the more correction we need to apply to our predicted state. The Kalman gain measures how much we <strong>DO NOT</strong> trust our system dynamics model, or conversely how much we <strong>DO</strong> trust our measurement. To simplify the math, let‚Äôs consider an 1D model with scalar equations. Imagine if \(K_k=0\), that means our predicted process variance \(\hat{P}_k\) must be 0; in other words, the <strong>probability distribution function</strong> (PDF) of the prediction is a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dirac delta function</a></strong> \(\delta(\hat{x}_k)\). Our EKF would thus fully trust our system dynamics model:</p> \[x_k = \hat{x}_k\] <p>At the other end of the spectrum, if \(K_k=1\), that means our measurement variance \({R}_k\) must be 0. The PDF of the measurement would then be a Dirac delta function \(\delta(y_k)\). Our EKF would then fully trust our measurement instead:</p> \[x_k = y_k\] <p>In reality, it is pretty much guaranteed that \(\mathbf{K}_k\) would be somewhere in between 0 and 1, and the output state \(\mathbf{x}_k\) would be somewhere in between the prediction and the measurement.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/quat_no_ekf-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/quat_no_ekf-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/quat_no_ekf-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/quat_no_ekf.png" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" title="Quat estimation w/o EKF" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-6 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/quat_ekf-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/quat_ekf-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/quat_ekf-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/quat_ekf.png" class="img-fluid rounded" width="100%" height="auto" title="Quat estimation w/ EKF" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A comparison of the target, estimated, and ground truth quaternion over time without (left) and with (right) EKF </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> ¬© Copyright 2024 Hunter Ma È©¨ÊÄùÂçö.
